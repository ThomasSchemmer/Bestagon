  - 'The main element of this game is playing and managing cards. You start with
    a small collection of cards (called your deck) which you will expand and upgrade
    throughout the game. You have a select few in your hand, ready to play.\nPlayed
    cards go to the discard deck, while you draw further cards from your deck over
    time.\nOnce your deck is empty, all cards in the discard pile will be shuffled
    and re-added. '
  - 'Cards represent available buildings and events and stay in your hand until you
    play them. While event cards usually cost nothing, buildings always have a construction
    price.\nYou have been giving a new "Treasure" event card, which will give you
    much needed wood.\nTo play a card first select it with [LEFT] from your hand
    and then [RIGHT] click on any tile. Please do so now. '
