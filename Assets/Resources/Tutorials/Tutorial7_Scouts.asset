  - Another unit available in the game is the scout. This unit can be placed onto
    the game world and is represented as a moveable figurine. They can move 1 tile
    per turn and most importantly will reveal new tiles surrounding them.
  - 'Tiles have three different discovery stages: Hidden, scouted, visited.\nHidden
    tiles are completely invisible. You can only guess that they are there because
    of the map size indicated by the white border on the background.\nScouted tiles
    have a visual representation, but are very basic: you cannot see the actual biome,
    only its base color.\nVisited tiles are fully revealed and you can see all available
    info for them. This is the only tile type you can build on!'
  - 'You have been given a scout card. Once played, this scout is represented on
    a tile and can be selected with [LEFT] as well as moved with [RIGHT] click.\nSimilar
    to the worker, scouts need to eat too. Starving scouts will refuse to move! In
    order to move your scout you will have to build a foragers hut, assign the worker
    and go to the next turn. '
