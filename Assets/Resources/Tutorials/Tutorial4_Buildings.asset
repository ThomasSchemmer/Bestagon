  Texts:
  - 'Once played, an event card is permanently destroyed and cannot be played again.\n\n
    Now that you have the necessary resources you have been given your first building:
    the claypit. You can build buildings similar to event cards by selecting them
    and interacting with a tile. The difference here is that you need resources to
    pay for construction and buildings can only be build on fitting tiles.'
  - Buildings can either affect only the tile its placed on, or surrounding tiles
    (which is indicated with a yellow highlight of the surrounding tiles). \nThe
    claypit can only be build on Meadows, Plains and Shrubland and costs you 2 wood.
    Its production is affected by surrounding tiles, so be careful where you place
    them - there is no moving it later.\n You can see a preview of its production
    on the bottom right.
