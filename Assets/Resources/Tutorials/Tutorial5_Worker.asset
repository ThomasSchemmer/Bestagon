  - Congratulations on building your first claypit - this is the first of many buildings
    your tribe will create.\n\nUnlike event cards, building cards can be played multiple
    times.\nEach building card has usability and each playing reduces this by 1.
    Once usability reaches 0 the card will be disabled for this game session, but
    not deleted - you will still have access to the card in other sessions.
  - 'You can check any buildings status by clicking on the tile its placed on. Its
    information will be displayed on the bottom right.\nThere are no workers assigned
    to the claypit, so it will not produce anything. '
  - You as the leader are responsible for assigning workers and hopefully keeping
    them alive. But first your tribe must have an idle worker. You have been given
    a new "Create Unit" card that will provide such a worker, use it like before.\nYou
    can see your current worker amount at the top, next to the resource list.
  - 'After you have created your worker, you can assign it by selecting the target
    building (your claypit) and clicking the icon displaying a simplified person
    on the right. Clicking it again will unassign the worker, in case you would like
    to assign it to some other building later. '
