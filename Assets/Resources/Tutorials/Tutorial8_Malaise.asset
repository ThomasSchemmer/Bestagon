  Texts:
  - '"The rumours are true, we are doomed!" The malaise has spread into your area\nBe
    extremely careful and avoid it at all costs: anything touched by the malaise
    is destroyed (including units and buildings)! '
  - The malaise will spread over time, every time you enter a new turn. It is divided
    into two phases, spreading (marked by a dashed red border) and infected (marked
    by a continuous red border).\nWhile the malaise-spread tiles do not have any
    negative effect yet, the next turn will fully infect the tile and destroy all
    tokens on it. The malaise also infects a few new tiles each turn, increasing
    over time.
  - Nobody really knows what the malaise actually is, as anybody coming close enough
    to inspect it is never heard from again.\nThere are whispers about an enclave
    to the north who is apparently unaffected, maybe that is where you should go?
