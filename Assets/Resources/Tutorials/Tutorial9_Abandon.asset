  Texts:
  - 'Bestagon is divided into two parts: the game round itself and the card upgrade
    screen. After each round you can spend available upgrade points on cards as well
    as manage what loadout you would like to start the next round with.\nTo end your
    turn and abandon your current tribe, click on the white flag icon above the minimap.'
  - 'You will have to abandon a lot of runs. If you run out of cards, out of food,
    or are cornered by the malaise you will not be able to progress further. You
    will keep all building cards as well as not-played event cards for the next round,
    but you will have to start again on a new map. '
  - 'You have been given a few more cards, a worker and resources - play until you
    feel ready to start the game. \nRemember: Try to find a way to stop the malaise,
    or this world will be lost forever!\nYou can end this tutorial by abandoning
    the run and going into the card selection'
