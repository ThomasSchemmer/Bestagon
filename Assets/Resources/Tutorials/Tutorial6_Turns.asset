  Texts:
  - This game is played in turns, each advancing the in-game time a small amount.
    There is no defined maximum number of turns, though there is a downside in taking
    too long, which will be explained later.\nYou can end your turn by clicking the
    arrow button on the bottom right. This will reset all available movement for
    units and grant resources according to production and consumption.
  - Each unit (e.g. worker) uses one food value per turn. \nYou in the beginning
    only have access to the most basic food resource Mushrooms, each providing only
    one food value. The more advanced food sources provide more food value, with
    the highest being Meat Pie.\nEach Meat Pie provides enough food for multiple
    worker or multiple turns, but will only be unlocked in the late game.
  - Any unit that is not working in a food production building can starve - starving
    units do not work and therefore produce nothing! \nThough they do not die from
    starvation, it is still recommended to always keep an eye on your food amount.\nPlease
    advance to the next turn now.
