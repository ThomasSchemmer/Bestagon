## About the Project
<i>
  Petar stumbles as he reaches your makeshift camp, exhausted and near collapse. His eyes are blood-red and the telltale pink foam dries around his mouth. He is infected by the malaise - and like so many other will die within days..
</i><br>
You are the leader of one of the last surviving tribes, fleeing from a red spore cloud called the Malaise. Anything it touches dies. And you are desperatly trying to keep your people alive, uprooted every week, scrambling to stay ahead.<br>
<br>
Create buildings and units by playing cards to improve your tribe. Find upgrades, new buildings and other unlockables by scouting the dangerous world. Die, because you couldn't outrun the malaise. Enhance your found cards and get a new start from the gods, but this time with better chances. You can even find a way to pet the dog :)
